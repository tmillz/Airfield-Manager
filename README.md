Source code for Airfield Manager on iOS

As an Airfield Manager I was faced with the challenge of tracking potholes and cracks on runways and taxiways then reporting their exact locations to civil engineers for repair.  The Airfield Manager app helps you do that and more.  Often we find ourselves in areas without internet connection and needing to reference regulations.  This app makes those regulations easy to find and read when you need them most, either out on the airfield or in a meeting.  You'll find useful specifications for common military aircraft such as wingspan, length, and Aircraft Classification Number.  Easy access to these specs reduces decision time and increases the safety of the airfield.  

Currently developing feature to sync map markers across iOS, Android and Web apps along with digital airfield inspection forms that can replace paper forms in the field.
